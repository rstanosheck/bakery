<h3>What is Our Mission?</h3>
	<p> 
		Our mission is to make every person that walks through our door, leave with a smile. We care about our customers and we see them
	as family. We even want to hear suggestions from you, our family. When you stop in, you can leave a note of something you would like us to make.
Making our customers happy makes us happy, we hope that we can make your day like you make ours. </p>

<h3>Our Story</h3>
	<p> When Sophia's Sweet Sensations started out we were just a small business out of our own kitchen. We have expanded our staff that consists of 
		family and friends. We have become very successful from the love that so many of our friends and families have shared with us and have
		kept it possible to keep thriving. So, come in, enjoy a sweet sensation, and become friends with us!
